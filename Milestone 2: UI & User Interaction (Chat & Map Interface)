Milestone 2: UI & User Interaction (Chat & Map Interface)
Objective:
The goal of this milestone is to develop and integrate the core user interfaces. This includes the chat interaction with the AI travel buddy and the creation of an interactive map to display missions and track location markers.
Deliverables:
1. Chat Interface (Completed)
Commponents:

UI design for the messaging interface where users interact with the AI travel buddy.
Ability for the AI buddy to provide real-time travel tips, cultural facts, and recommendations based on user location.
Log user and AI conversations to the backend for continuity and reference.
# Progress:

UI Design: Completed, with wireframe layout and digital mockup finalized.
Backend Connection: Completed. Integrated with Firebase to store conversations.
## 2. Interactive Map (In Progress)
Components:
Design and implement the interactive map interface.
Display mission locations, nearby landmarks, and points of interest (POIs).
Users can click on mission markers for details and track their mission progress.
Progress:
Map UI: Initial wireframe completed.
Marker Placement: In progress, working on configuring the markers for missions and POIs.
Real-time Updates: Still being integrated to reflect user progress dynamically as they complete missions.
3. Navigation Setup (In Progress)
Components:

Implement seamless navigation between Chat Interface, Interactive Map, and other core screens (Profile, Settings).
Set up Tab Navigation for easy access to core features: Explore Map, Missions, Rewards, Profile, and Settings.
Create Flow Navigation between screens like Chat, Missions, and Profile.
Progress:

Basic Navigation: Completed for Chat and Map screens.
Ongoing: Working on final integration for the reward system and linking back to Profile and Settings screens.
4. Backend Setup for UI (In Progress)
Components:
Connect the front-end UI with Firebase for retrieving user location, mission data, and AI responses.
Ensure Firebase is set up to store and fetch real-time user progress on missions and store user-AI interactions.
Progress:
Firebase Integration: In progress. Backend for storing conversations and mission data is functional, but real-time mission tracking is still being refined.
Remaining Tasks for Milestone 2:
Complete Interactive Map:

Finalize the placement of mission markers and POIs on the map.
Complete the integration of real-time user progress updates on the map to track missions dynamically.
Finalize Navigation:

Complete the full flow between Chat, Map, Missions, Rewards, and Profile screens to ensure smooth navigation between core features.
Test Core Features:

Conduct internal testing of both the Chat Interface and Interactive Map to ensure they function properly.
Verify that Firebase data retrieval and storage are working as expected.
Documentation:

Update the README with links to updated wireframes, design mockups, and any further documentation that explains the navigation flow and core features.
